================
  Generation 3
================

  polymer-1
  ---------
  add x-pages and additional UI to projects/mail; trying to uncover more natural data-binding patterns
  implement missing bookkeeping and algorithm for merging DataClient datums 
  
  polymer-0
  ---------
  there is enough promising code, begin trying to organize a bit
  use jmesserly's superior implementation of the UberStore concept (now DataClient)
  nascent unification (at implementation) of the standard three DOM-binding patterns (.textContent, .<property>, attributes.<property>.value)
  connect DataClient with DOM-binding logic, a discrete fourth pattern for DOM-binding

================
  Generation 2
================

  impelement-a
  ------------
  (note-taking fail)
  
  impelement-9
  ------------
  algorithm to create template annotation map for declarative DOM attachments
  utilize ubserstore for binding/observation (*one step too many for one iteration) 
  
  impelement-8
  ------------
  ==================
  increase (rough) fidelity to basic Gmail page to add complexity 
  
  impelement-7
  ------------
  factor common component code into Polymer() sugaring 
  semi-extreme factoring into elements to simplify app.html 
  ** changed the position of perfStart to avoid more network latency
  
  impelement-6
  ------------
  removed MDV
  
  impelement-5
  ------------
  additional lists arranged to roughly recreate GMail desktop for complexity gauge
  
  impelement-4
  ------------
  (note-taking fail)
  
  impelement-3.5
  --------------
  added MDV
  
  impelement-3
  ------------
  (note-taking fail)
  
  impelement-2
  ------------
  1000 x-items generated by script against mock data
  
  impelement-1
  ------------
  bare-bones element system
  just one x-item
